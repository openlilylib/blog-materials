\section*{Website structure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Front Page\\
Very short, very concise, good.\\
Starting text may be extended a little bit.\\
Points to:
\item \textbf{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Our Goal}\\
		Idea is good.\\
		Second paragraph is somewhat illogical.\\
		Could be slightly more elaborate.\\
		Maybe rename to “Our Mission”?
	\item\textbf{ What LilyPond does}\\
		Simply links\\
		--- Features: Good\\
		--- Examples: Good\\
		--- Freedom: What does it do here?\\
		--- Background: What does it do here?
	\item \textbf{LilyPond in use}\\
		Simply links\\
		--- Productions\\
		--- Reviews\\
		Good. But maybe something from Community should be linked here
	\item \textbf{How LilyPond works}\\
		Simply links\\
		--- Text input: Good
		--- Easier Editing: Good, but rename to “Editing”
	\end{itemize}
	Has to be considerable restructured.\\
	Maybe make sections:\\
	\begin{itemize}
	\item What Sets LilyPond Apart:\\
	--- Features\\
	--- Examples\\
	--- Text Input\\
	--- Editing (not “Easier”)\\
	--- Background\\
	--- Freedom
	\item 
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Features}\\
This page is \emph{very} problematic! Has to be completely restructured\\
A big problem here is that much of the information is redundant.\\
Missing:\\
--- Version control
\end{itemize}
